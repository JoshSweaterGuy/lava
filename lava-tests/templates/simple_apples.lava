    This is the dream with templating in this file
    params:
        - apples -> array of apples
        - people -> array of people
    ~~~~~~~~
    tabdef: default = 1, sets the depth of tabs to subtract for injecting back (recursive)
    ANY FREE TEXT is in inline call as well as any text generated in exclamations
    NO comments appear in final or star(*) commands
