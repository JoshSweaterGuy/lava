# HIV
--- 
discussed in [[Module 9]]
HIV is a [[Viruses]]

Family: Retroviridae
Genus: lentiviruses

**HIV is a retrovirus**
- small RNA genomes
- reverse transcription makes DNA copy of RNA genome
- DNA copy can  lay dorment
- eventually can be transcribes to RNA
## Biology
![[HIV Structure Image.png]]
![[HIV Genome img.png]]
- GAG, POL and ENV are key genes found in all retroviruses (memorize)
- LTR = Long Terminal Repeat; does not code for a protein, instead encodes instructions for the expression and packaging of the genome

**Multiple viral proteins are made from the three key precursor proteins**


**Gag** processed to form:
– matrix protein
– capsid protein
– others
**Pol** processed to form:
– Reverse transcriptase
– Protease
– Integrase
**Env** processed to form:
– gp120
– gp41

**High mutation rate**, mutates everyday 1/10,000
so there are many different mutations of HIV

can remain **latent** for long periods of time
and infected cells cannot be recognized

gp120 on the virus attaches to CD4 on [[Macrophages and Dendritic Cells]] (T-Cells)

HIV Protease cuts up a
precursor protein (e.g.,
Pol) into its smaller
functional proteins (e.g.,
reverse transcriptase,

## History
HIV started as a to spread among the homosexual community, and it was initially called GRID(gay related immune dificiency)

there are 2 HIV's HIV-1, HIV-2 basi ally the same, HIV-1 more common

HIV comes from chimpanzees (SIV -> HIV)

much of HIV is in Africa

## AIDS
- HIV can cause AIDS
- AIDS results when the CD4+T cells are depleted causeing severe immune dificiency and an increase tp oppotunistic infections
- if CD4 Lymphocite level is below 300 then you  

attacks CD4+[[T Cells]]

- People with CCR5 Gene mutation are more resistent to HIV 
 - 1/3 of people that die from HIV die from HIV tuberculosis

### Oppotunistic Infections
- Lymphoma
- [[Tuberculosis]]
- Thrush
