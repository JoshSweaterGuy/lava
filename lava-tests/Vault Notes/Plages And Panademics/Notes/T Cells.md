T cells directly recognize infected cells

**T Cell Receptor(TCR)** to bind and be activated by antigen

antigens recognized by the TCR are **short peptides** that are presented on the surface of cells by a special molecule called **MHC**

**TCRs bind to BOTH the peptife and the MHC**
TCRs are very specific: only responds to their specific peptides
- example: TCR that recognizes flu peptide only respond to that peptide

Vast majority of your T-cells do not participate in the immune response to a specifi pathogen

**APC**'s are Antigen presenting cells; what T cells latch onto
Phagocytes can funtion as APCs
Dendritic Cells are particularly good APC's

>Ralph Steinman won the nobel prize about finding the role of dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, he died a few days before he was awarded it

### Types of T Cells
**2 main types of T Cells**
- **Cytotoxic T lymphocytes**: function is to specifically kill virally-infected cells. also called CD8 T cells because of unique CD8 receptor on their cell surface
- **Helper T lymphocytes**: primary function is to produce cytokines. Alsio called CD4 T cells because they have a special receptor on their surface called CD4. Direct other cells to respond to pathogen.

CD8 T cells very specific and kills infected cells by injecting a toxin
