# Zoonosis

discussed in [[Module 6]]


A disproportionate amount of zoonosis is RNA

## Nipah Virus

Nipah virus is endemic to fruit bats which live in Southeast Asia. The virus does not affect them, but they carry it and can spread it through their bodily fluids, like saliva or urine.

since 2001, nearly yearly outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh
due to custom to eat the sap from trees, the bats eat the sap and leave the virus. 
solution: Coverings over the sap with net

3 nepah outbreaks in India

**Symptoms**
- enciphilitis: Inflamation of the brain
- incubation time 5-14 days
- 3-14 days of fever followed by headache
- fatality is 45%-80%
## Chagas Disease (Trypanosoma cruzi)
- kissing bug spread this disease; common in mexico and south america
- the person becomes infected when they scratch the fecenes into the open wound after being bit


- carlos chagas was the scientist that discovered t. cruzi


- Left untreated, Chagas disease later can cause serious heart and  digestive problems eventually resulting in debilitating heart and/ or intestinal disease.

- Treatable if medicines are given soon after infection

- There is no vaccine to prevent Chagas disease.
- Insecticide spraying
- Home improvements
- Good hygiene practices
Personal preventive measures
- Screening of blood donors
- Testing of organ, tissue and cell
donors and receivers

**Carlos Chagas**: Brazilian scientist who discovered an unknown pathogen, its vector, hosts, clinical manifestations, and epidemiology  


# West Nile Virus
The most common mosquito-borne disease in the United States as of 2020

resides in the bird population

humans get it from horses or mysquitos

most people are asymptomatic
1 to 5 people who are infected develop fever

leading cause of mysquito born disease

moniter west nile by caging chickens to see if they get it

# Nepah Virus
Nipah virus transmission does not require a vector
There is no treatment or vaccine
Nipah virus infection can cause fatal encephalitis


# Bats as Reservoir

bats are genetically similar to humans so bats cause more disease than most animals
