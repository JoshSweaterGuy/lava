# **Robert Koch**
---
discussed in [[Module 1]]

>**Koch’s big discovery that microbes make people sick and different microbes can make people sick in different ways.**


Koch discovered the cause of [[Tuberculosis]]
([[Mtb]] causes TB)
results are slow to come in for mtb because it grows so slow

>Robert Koch won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905
"for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis."

Experimented with Anthrax and mice 
Figured out that bacteria causes diseases by injecting anthrax into mice
used [[Control Variables]]

the ability to isolate single colonies is a critical technique of microbiology

used potato slices and and AGAR petri dishes to grow pure cultures of bacteria

**Koch's Postulates**: necessary conditions that must be fulfilled to prove a microbe causes a disease
1. The microorganism must be found in all organisms suffering from the disease (but not in healthy organisms.)
2. The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.
3. The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
4. The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

### Typhoid Mary
Mary Mallon, was an aymptomatic carrior of Salmonella typhimurium
aymptomatic carrior violate [[Koch]]'s postulates.

### Pettenkofer
Pettenkofer famously drink [[Cholera]] microbe infected water to try to disprove [[Koch]] and his theory that microbes cause disease.

## Staining Bacteria
created by Hans christian Gram
with gram stain...
Gram-negative is pink
Gram-positive is dark purple

**Gram-positive**
- Streptococcus pyogenes (strep throat, flesh-eating disease)
- Staphylococcus (e.g., MRSA, Toxic Shock Syndrome)
- Bacillus anthracis (anthrax); sometimes variable

**Gram-negative**
- Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague)
- Vibrio cholerae (cholera)
- Legionella pneumophila (Legionnaires’ Disease)

**Gram variable**
- e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) (ACID FAST)
