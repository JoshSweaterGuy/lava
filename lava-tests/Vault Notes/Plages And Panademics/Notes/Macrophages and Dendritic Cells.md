**Macrophages and Dentritic cells detect pathogens to initiate immune responses**

**Macrophages and Dendritic Cells detect PAMPs**

## PAMPs
**PAMP**: Pathogen-associated molecular pattern
**PRR**: Binds to PAMPs, PRR sends signals that start immune response
- PAMPs are relativly invarient
This is important so one PRR can recognize **many** pathogens
- PAMPs are found on pathogens, However they are also on other microbes and the term is MAMP


**Examples of PAMPs**
Flagellin, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), [[Peptidoglycan]] (PGN) are all PAMPS

## PRRs

**TLRs** are a family of very important PRRs that detect extracellular PAMPs


**TLR4** binds to LPS

**TLR5** binds to flagellin

## Cytokines
The most important immune activation factors to know are called **cytokines**

- secreted proteins and are 'alert signals' that travel through blood/tissue to tell nearby cells that theres is an infection
- one example is Tumer Necrosis Factor (TNF)
- Host macrophages or DC secretes TNF
- too much TNF can be toxic! therefore too much LPS makes too much TNF and is toxic.

- Lethal dose of LPS for humans can be as little as 1-2μg
(1μg = 1/1000th of a gram)
- LPS in the blood stream (e.g., from a gram-negative
bacterial infection) can cause an immune-response
syndrome called **Sepsis** that is often lethal
>150,000 sepsis-related deaths per year in the US

LPS and Sepsis

- anti-TNF antibody is a multibillion dollar drug
- used to treat Crohn's Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis
- taking it increases suceptability to diseases, especiakky [[Tuberculosis]]
