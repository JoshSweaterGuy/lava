# Cancer
---

discussed in [[Module 10]]



-Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. Cancer develops when the body’s normal control mechanism stops working. Old cells do not die and instead grow out of control, forming new, abnormal cells.


- Usually, cancer occurs from multiple mutations over a lifetime. That is why cancer occurs more often in older people. They have had more opportunities for mutations to build up

- Proto-oncogenes: proteins that normally contribute positively to cell proliferation.
- Mutations alter the regulation of these proto-oncogenes, they can’t be turned off. These “constantly activated” protooncogens are called oncogenes
- Tumor suppressor genes: proteins that prevent the unwanted
proliferation of mutant cells.::: Mutations might render these tumor suppressor genes
ineffective
