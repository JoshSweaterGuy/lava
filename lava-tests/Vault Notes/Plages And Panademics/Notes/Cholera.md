# Cholera
---
discussed in [[Module 4]]
cholera is a [[Bacteria]]


## Symptoms
- rice-water stool, dehydration
- unlike other diseases, **little inflammatory response** to cholera. death cause by diharrhea and water loss.
- you get cholera by ingesting feces "fecal-oral"
- infectious dose quite high
- spreads by infecting the water stream
- **self-limiting**: will cease without antibiotic treatment

Treatment for cholera is **oral rehydration therapy**

## Epidemics
Cholera is endemic in many places still

Has had explosive global pandemics
**2 strains** 
- the "Classic" strain
- "El Torr" strain

"El Torr" strain took over classic strain

- 2010 Cholera outbreak in haiti was started by an asyptomatic "UN Peacekeeper"

- Pacini was the first to describe comma-shaped bacterium in the stool of cholera patients. 1883

- unaware of Pacini's work [[Koch]] rediscovered cholera, and the first to culture it

- John snow found out that Cholera came from water

## Vibrio Cholera
- V. Cholera causes cholera

- V. Cholera creates toxin called Cholera Toxin




## Cholera Toxin(CT)
Cholera Toxin causes diarhea 

2 parts A and B subunit
A Subunit: The actual toxin
B subunit: binds to human cells

CTA tricks cells into pumping out water and sodium ions
Many different AB type toxins
Oral rehydration therapy has glucose and sodium and water to replace the lost nutrients

## Not all Vibrio cholerae causes disease
- non-toxigeniuc can be recovered and not cause disease in humans; no CT
- V. cholera aquired CT from a bacteria phage(virus that infects bacteria) that infected it
- the phage for CT is CTX(fi)
- the phage injected its DNA into the DNA of V. cholera
