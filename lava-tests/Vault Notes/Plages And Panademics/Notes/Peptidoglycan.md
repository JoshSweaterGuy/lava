# Peptidoglycan (PGN)
---
discussed in [[Bacteria]]
>**Both gram positive and gram negative bacteria use peptidoglycan (PGN) in their cell walls**
- Archaea lack peptidoglycan
- Many antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) work by disrupting the cell wall peptidoglycan
- **Lysozyme** (a ubiquitous anti-bacterial enzyme present in bodily fluids) also digests peptidoglycan
- PGN allows bacteria to maintain high internal pressure (approximately the same as a car tire) without lysing
- is a **PAMP**; see [[Macrophages and Dendritic Cells]] for more

- made up of chains of **sugars** (NAG and NAM)

- gives streanth and regidity in the outer cell wall

- certain antibiotics(penicilin) disrupt crosslinks in PGN and make bacteria rupture (called lysis)
