# Plague
---
discussed in [[Module 4]]

## Different forms of plague
- **Bubonic Plague**: fever Bubos, lymph nodes; ~50% mortality rate
- **Septicemic Plague**: in the blood, inflammation, fever ; ~100% mortality rate
- **Pnemonic plague**: in the lungs, fever, pnemonia; ~100% mortality rate

- **Yersinia pestis** cause all forms of plague

- **DIC**: inappropriate blood clotting, can cause bleeding, in sepricemic plague, origins of name black death
## Treatment
- replicates very quickly
- Yersinia pestis is susceptible to many [[Antibiotics]]
- Early administration of antibiotics is key
- vaccines being developed, but no vaccine availble currently
- US troops were vaccinated with experimental vaccine during vietnam war

## How it Spreads
- most commonly transmitted by fleas, it regurgtates bacteria into host
- Marmots can be hosts for plague and flea takes it and spreads to humans
- plague is a **zoonosis**, and infection aquired from animals
- **Sylvatic cycle** is trandmittion of plague in wild animals
- **Urban cycle** is among domestic rodents
- Bubonic plague in humans, not favorable, is a 'dead end'; pnemonic plague mroe favorable
- FMF mutations is protective against plague do to the widespread epidemic
- Plague keeps appearing
- unlikly we can eradicate plague

## Yersinia pestis
**Yersinia pestis is a [[Bacteria]] that causes plague**

bacteria refered to as **genus** and **species**
**Yersinia**=genus(upper case; can be abbreviated) **pestis**=species(lower cased)

>Discovered in 1894 by Shibasaburo(student of [[Koch]]) and Yersin(student of [[Pasteur]])

- Yersinia pestis is considered to be an "extracellular" pathogen, has to survive outside of cells
- Yops are proteins secreted into host macrophages
- Y. pestis is **gram negative**

### LPS modifications
- Yersinia modifies its LPS to avoid detection by TLR4
- **Lipid A** in LPS is made up of **acyl chains**
- most LPS has 6 acyl chains, but **Y. pestis has 4 acyl chains** and avoids detection by TLR4

### Virulence factors
**Virulence factors** are molecules produced by bacteria to
block or evade the host innate immune response, e.g.:
1. **Pla**: “plasminogen activator”; a protease on the bacterial
surface that blocks blood coagulation and complement
2. **Capsule**: a coat on the surface of the bacteria that may
inhibit phagocytosis of the bacteria
3. **Yops**: proteins secreted into host macrophages that
block phagocytosis and cytokine production
4. **Type III Secretion System (T3SS)**: used to inject Yops
into cells

**Type III Secretion System (T3SS)** are used by  many bacterial pathogens to inject bacterial proteins into host cells.

Aquired virtualence factors from other bacteria; bacteria often share small circular pieces of DNA called plasmids
