# RNA
discussed in [[Module 2]]

>unlike [[DNA]] RNA uses uridine (U) instead of T (A pairs with U or T)

- RNA is difficult to repair
- DNA is preffered as the genetic material
- RNA in not for living things

RNA used as a messeneger temporary 

Information gets to cells by 
DNA (transcription)-> RNA(translation) -> [[Protein]]

RNA can be made from a DNA template

## Translation

groups of three to translate to protein

(AUG)CG
->translates to one protein amino acid

ribosome "reads" the RNA and makes protein

Ribosomes made of RNA and protein
