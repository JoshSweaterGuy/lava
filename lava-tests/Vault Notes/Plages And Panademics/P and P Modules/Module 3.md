### Quiz Questions
1. [1 points] Please agree to the following statements: I agree that I am completing this quiz entirely on my own without assistance from any other person. I understand that the consequence of cheating is that I will receive an F for the class.
(X) True ( ) False
2. [2 points] List one difference and one similarity between the T cell receptor and the B cell receptor.
Similarities: activate the T/B cell, bind antigen, etc.
Differences: not secreted/secreted, doesn’t require/ does require MHC, etc.
3. [1 point] A Bacillus anthracis bacterium is coated in antibodies and eaten by a macrophage. This is an example of:
a. ( ) Antibody neutralization
b. (X) Opsonization
c. ( ) Clonal expansion
d. ( ) Immunological memory
e. ( ) Complement activation
4. [1 point] After being infected, it can take several days for the B cell response to “ramp up” and for the amount of antibody in the blood to reach levels that could protect against infection. What is one reason for the delayed response?
Takes time for resting B cells to undergo clonal expansion and for those B cells to start pumping out antibodies. I think it’s okay for the students to just describe this process without specifically saying “clonal expansion” or “plasma blasts”
5. [ 1 point] Let’s compare two hypothetical infectious diseases in a community: Disease A is caused by a pathogen that has an R0 = 2 and Disease B is caused by a pathogen that has an R0 = 8. Based on the R0 (R naught) values, which of the below statements is true?
a. ( ) Someone with Disease A is likely to infect more people that someone with Disease B.
b. (X) When compared to Disease A, more people in the community need to be vaccinated against Disease B to achieve herd immunity.
c. ( ) Disease B is more lethal than Disease A.
d. ( ) Disease A is spreading through the community faster than Disease B.
6. [ 1 point] Which of the below vaccine strategies typically requires an added adjuvant? a. (x) Recombinant protein vaccines
b. ( ) Viral vector vaccines
c. ( ) Inactivated vaccines
d. ( ) DNA vaccines
e. ( ) Live attenuated vaccines
7. [ 1 point] Why is variolation not considered a vaccination?
a. (X) Variolation involves infection with the actual pathogen instead of a pathogen
mimic
b. ( ) Variolation doesn’t induce any memory B cells or memory T cells
c. ( ) Variolation doesn’t need an adjuvant
d. ( ) Variolation has a high mortality rate compared to the diseases it protects
against
e. ( ) Variolation is a form of passive immunity
8. [1 point] Briefly explain how the strategy of ring vaccination was implemented to eliminate smallpox.
All people in contact with a case (a ‘ring’ of people around that case) were immunized to prevent smallpox from spreading.
9. [2 points] Hypothetically, let’s say a vaccine was developed for SARS-CoV2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Let’s also say this protects the vaccinated individual from COVID-19 disease but does not prevent that individual from being infected by or transmitting the SARS-CoV2 virus. What effect would this vaccine have on R0 for SARS-CoV2? would this vaccine still provide herd immunity? Explain (in one sentence).
There would be no effect on R0 or herd immunity (1 point). Changes in R0 and establishment of herd immunity depends on reducing transmission. (1 point)
10. [5 points] As we discussed in class, Moderna is currently testing their COVID-19 vaccine in a Phase 3 clincal trial. You work for the FDA and are responsible for granting approval to Moderna to distribute and market their vaccine. Hypothetically, let’s say Moderna requests this approval without first finishing their phase 3 trial. They claim that there were no serious side effects in their phase 2 trial and that the ongoing COVID-19 crisis requires an exceptional and more rapid approval. Explain why you would turn down Moderna’s request. In your answer, be sure to reference the kind of vaccine Moderna is developing (1 point), why approving this type of vaccine might be risky (1 point), and three reasons why phase 3 trials are important to complete (3 points).
Moderna is developing an mRNA vaccine (1 point) and that might be risky because there are no known mRNA vaccines (i.e., its safety profile is unknown) (1 point), and phase III trials are important to complete because they are the only way to establish efficacy (1 point) and safety (1 point) and thus the only way to convince the public to take the vaccine once it is available (i.e., to refute vaccine hesitancy/concerns about vaccine safety) (1 point).
