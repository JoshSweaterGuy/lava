### Module Notes

- Pasteur disproved spontanious generation based on Spallanzani's design

- leeuwenhoek was not a classically trained scientist, and he discovered microbes

- Koch discovered that a bacteria causes Tuberculosis



### Quiz Questions

What is NOT an example of fermentation?
- **The fungus Penicillium roqueforti using oxygen to create the characteristic flavors of blue cheese**
- The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing CO2 in bread dough
- The bacterium Lactobacillus bulgaricus turning lactose into lactic acid in a yogurt culture
- The yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxxi converting sugars into ethanol during the production of soy sauce

During Pasteur’s “swan-necked flask” experiment, he intentionally opened the top of some of his flasks to expose them to falling microbes from the air. What was the purpose this action?

- To prove Spallanzani was wrong
- **To serve as a positive control to confirm the broth could support bacterial growth**
- To serve as a back-up incase his “swan-neck” idea didn’t work
- To serve as a negative control to confirm that the broth could not support bacterial growth


What statement is FALSE?

- **Before Koch’s animal experiments, Tuberculosis was thought to be an inherited disease.**
- Koch’s first postulate includes growing a pure culture of the suspected microbe
- Pasteur’s experiments helped disprove the theory of Spontaneous Generation
- Some microbes will die if exposed to oxygen in the air

Which statement is TRUE?

- Leeuwenhoek built the first known microscopes
- English surgeon Joseph Lister was highly skeptical of Pasteur’s experiments
- The Germ Theory of Disease began to take shape about 100 years after Pasteur and Koch performed their famous experiments
- **Acid-fast staining is a way to visualize Mycobacterium tuberculosis under a microscope**

You are trying to prove that the blood of a dead deer contains the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) by injecting the deer’s blood into healthy mice and showing that these mice also become sick. What is the best NEGATIVE control for this experiment?

- Inject some healthy mice with a known sample of M. bovis
- Inject some deer with a known sample of M. bovis
- **Inject some healthy mice with blood from a healthy deer**
- Leave some mice untouched (no injection)

What did Koch achieve by passaging the anthrax bacilli several times in the aqueous humor from ox eyes, or by "streaking out" bacteria cultures on potato slices or agar plates? What do these procedures accomplish that is important for subsequent experiments with the bacteria?

**Pure culture and/or was able to rid of contaminants**

Max von Pettenkofer famously drank a culture of Vibrio cholerae and claimed that he did not get disease, in an attempt to undermine Koch's claim that V. cholerae causes cholera. Which of Koch's postulates was von Pettenkofer attempting to disprove? (state the postulate, not just the number)

**Postulate 3**

We now know V. cholerae is indeed the cause of cholera. Provide two explanations for von Pettenkofer's result:

**Maybe he had had cholera before and his immune system was able to fight it off, or he simply did not drink enough of the pathogen.**

There has been an outbreak of food poisoning at your favorite local burrito stand, and you’ve been asked to help determine what microbe is making people sick. You suspect the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium perfringens and succeed in isolating this pathogen from several sick customers but no healthy customers. Briefly outline how you would apply Koch’s second, third, and fourth postulates to test your hypothesis about C. perfringens. For the third postulate, also describe one positive and one negative control.

- Second: grow a pure culture
- Third: infect healthy mice/people/etc. to see if they get the same disease
- Positive control: infect mice/people/etc. with known culture of C. perfringens
- Negative control: mock infection of other individuals
- Fourth: isolate bacteria from the intentionally infected mice/people/etc. and see if it’s the same organism isolated from the sick customers
