### Quiz Questions


Which of the following statements is TRUE of peptidoglycan?
- Peptidoglycan is only found in gram positive bacteria
- **Peptidoglycan provides rigidity and strength to the bacterium**
- Peptidoglycan blocks the host immune response
- Peptidoglycan is found in all microbes, including viruses, bacteria and protozoan parasites

We learned that David Vetter, aka the “Bubble Boy”, lacked adaptive immunity but not innate immunity. Briefly describe TWO ways that the innate immune system can kill invading bacteria.
- One correct (examples: Phagocytosis by macrophages/neutrophils,
reactive oxygen, reactive nitrogen, lysozyme to degrade the bacterium, acidic pH
to kill bacteria, antibacterial peptides, fatty acids, competitors
(lactoferrin to bind iron, proteins to sequester vitamins), etc.)

Select the below statement that is TRUE regarding bacteria.
- Like all cells, bacteria have a nucleus
- The small size of bacteria limits their ability to adapt to new environments
- Bacteria have less species diversity than mammals
- **Compared to multi-cellular organisms, bacteria can evolve quickly
- Archaea are a kind of bacteria**

Briefly explain (1 sentence each) one similarity and one difference between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
- Both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have peptidoglycan, but one difference is that gram-negative has lipopolysaccharides.

Autoimmune diseases occur when a person’s immune system:
- Doesn’t have enough PRRs
- Is missing adaptive immunity
- **Responds to “self” tissue as if it were a pathogen**
- Is blocked with anti-TNF antibodies
- Is missing innate immunity

What is one advantage of having PRRs that recognize multiple pathogens?

- [not listed]

Injection of LPS alone into the bloodstream, in the absence of any pathogen, can be lethal. Why?
- LPS is a PAMP that can cause a toxic amount of the cytokine TNF to be made
- LPS is a PRR that can over-activate the adaptive immune system
- LPS is a PAMP that prevents immune cells, like macrophages, from being activated
- LPS is a PRR that makes you susceptible to autoimmune diseases

You are a bacterium trying to infect a human host via their mucosal surfaces. Name one mucosal surface we discussed in class and briefly describe TWO ways in which that physical barrier protects against microbial entry.

- one mucosal surface we discussed in class is the nose. the nose protects against microbial entry by trapping pathogens in the mucus, and another way is it limits the size of  the passage way to not let as many microbes in.
