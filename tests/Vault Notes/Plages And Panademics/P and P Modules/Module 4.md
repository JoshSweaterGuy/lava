### Module Notes

Y. pestis virulence factor genes were carried on a plasmid
V. cholerae cholera toxin genes were carried by a phage/ CTX phi/ CTX phage


### Quiz Questions
2. [ 3 points] Name ONE Yersinia pestis virulence factor (1 point) and describe what it does (2 points).
a. Pla (plasminogen activator): a protease on the bacterial surface that blocks blood coagulation and complement
b. Capsule: a coat on the surface of bacteria that may inhibit phagocytosis of the bacteria
c. Yops: proteins secreted into host macrophages that block phagocytosis and cytokine production
d. Type III secretion system (T3SS): used to inject yops into cells
3. [ 1 point] Why is it incorrect to say that M. tuberculosis has a sylvatic cycle? a. ( ) Because M. tuberculosis primarily infects the lungs
b. (X) Because M. tuberculosis does not have an animal reservoir
c. ( ) Because M. tuberculosis is often resistant to antibiotics
d. ( ) Because M. tuberculosis can transition from latent to active, but not vice-versa
4. [2 points] Cholera toxin is composed of an A subunit and a B subunit. Briefly (one sentence each) describe the function of each of these subunits.
The B subunit binds to human cells to deliver the A subunit.
The A subunit induces intestinal cells to make cAMP and/or activate their chloride pumps, which then causes sodium to escape the cell as well. Loss of sodium chloride results in loss of water from the cells, leading to diarrhea.
5. [1 point] You need to diagnose cases of active TB, and your priorities are SPEED and SPECIFICITY. Which test should you choose?
a. ( ) Chest x-ray
b. (X) The smear test c. ( ) The culture test d. ()TSTtest
6. [2 point] As they evolved into the pathogens that exist today, both Y. pestis and V. cholera acquired genes encoding specific virulence factors. However, the virulence genes were transmitted via different DNA-containing transmissible elements.
Y. pestis virulence factor genes were carried on a plasmid
V. cholerae cholera toxin genes were carried by a phage/ CTX phi/ CTX phage
7. [ 1 point] Select the statement below that correctly describes a COMMONALITY between Plague, Tuberculosis, and Cholera:
a. ( ) Their natural hosts are humans and at least one other animal
b. ( ) They are all potentially aerosol transmissible
c. ( ) They are all extracellular pathogens
d. (X) Children in the United States are not vaccinated against these pathogens
8. [3 points] What are the three major components of oral rehydration therapy, and how do they each help reverse the effects of cholera diarrhea? (1 point each)
a. Answer:
water – replaces lost fluid
glucose – induces uptake of salt (or activated sodium pump) salt – replaces lost electrolytes/salt
9. [1 point] Latent tuberculosis is typically characterized by:
a. ( ) coughing, weight loss, and occasional diarrhea
b. ( ) highly contagious spread of aerosolized bacteria
c. ( ) the absence of any detectable immune response
d. (X) a positive tuberculin skin test or IGRA test
e. ( ) BCG vaccination
10. [1 point] The BCG vaccine:
a. ( ) provides strong protection against pulmonary tuberculosis
b. ( ) is an inactivated vaccine
c. ( ) is a recombinant protein vaccine
d. (X) is derived from a pathogen of cows
e. ( ) promotes immunity via expression of the ESX-1 secretion system
