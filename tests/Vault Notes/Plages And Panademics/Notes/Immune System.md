# Immune System

discussed in [[Module 2]]
discussed in [[Module 3]]

- Without immune system, we would not survive long
- Bubble  boy - born without an immune system, lived in a bubble, died of herpes through bone marrow transplant
- Immune system saves our life everyday
- inappropriate immune activation also kills many, many people
- Autoimmune diseases: Diabetes, Celiac Disease, Lupus, etc..
 **Inflammation** - tries to return irritants back to homeostasis redness, heat, pain, swelling


- immunity is a "double-edged" sword

- mammalian immune system has 2 parts

## Innate immunity
- present in normal individuals at all times
- does not increase with repeated exposure
- responsible for initial recognition of pathogen
- targets general features shared among many pathogens
- usually sufficient to clear most infections
- other than B Cells and T Cells, **the rest of the white blood cells are a part of the Innate immune system**

### Parts List for Innate Immunity
**Physical Barriors** that prevent entry
**Blood cells** that moniter tissue for pathogens that breach physical barriors. immune cells produce several important factors:

1. **Sensor proteins** that detect pathogens
Physical barriers that prevent pathogen entry
Blood Cells that monitor tissue for pathogens that breach
physical barriers. Immune cells produce several important
factors:
3. **Enzymes** and other molecules that kill the pathogens: can be preexisting
or inducibly produced
2. **Cytokines** that alert and activate more immune cells

## Adaptive immunity
- generally slower to respond than innate immunity
- increases in strength with repeated exposure (exhibits ‘memory’)
- involves special cells called B and T lymphocytes
- highly specific for specific “antigens” unique to individual pathogens
- required for “vaccination”
- discussed in detail next lecture
- [[B Cells]] and [[T Cells]] are white blood cells part of the Adaotive immune system


**[[White Blood Cells]]** circulate through blood vessels and **the lymph system**

- The initiation of adaptive immune responses often begin in lymph nodes nearest to the site of infection
- Constantly scan for signs of infection
- The liquid part of blood is called plasma; this contains antimicrobial proteins (e.g., antibodies). Plasma diffuses through tissues and is collected by a system of vessels called the lymphatic system 
- Lymph vessels coalesce in structures called nodes, which contain lots of WBCs
- The initiation of adaptive immune responses often begin in lymph nodes nearest to the site of infection
