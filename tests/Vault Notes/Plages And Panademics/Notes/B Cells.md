**B cells job is to make antibodies**

>B cells and [[T Cells]] are both types of white blood cells
called "lymphocites"

## Antibodies
Antibodies are proteins
an Antibody(Ab) is sometimes called an Immunoglobulin(Ig)

Anything bound by antibodies are antigens(Ags)
- this includes LPS and other part of virus or molecule
- both arms have to have the same antigen

Epitope is the precise part of an antigen that is bound to an antibody

epitope contains [[Amino Acids]]

**Antibodies are highly specific**
- therefore generally wont cross react 
- an antigen that is not like the other on the antibody wont bind

**Antibodies can to specifically recognize(bind to) almost anything  (not just proteins)**

- antibodies can bind to Phosphotyrosine, Synthetic non naterual molecules, and Sugars.

Antibodies can bind to DNA, not very good though
*Diseases like lupus do this*

**How do antibodies protect against infection?**
1. **Neutralization** (inhibition or inactivation of the pathogen or
its toxins)
2. **Opsonization** (promotion of phagocytosis)
3. ** Complement activation** (Complement is a group of special proteins in the blood that can directly kill bacteriaâ€¦often activated by antibodies)

**Different Types of Antibodies**
![[antibody isotopes img.png]]

the constant area in antibodies is very constant among antibodies
the varible part in antibodies is extremely variable

- An antibody on the surface of a B cell is called a B call receptor(BCR) 
- **resting B cells** turn to **plasma cells** that secrete many antibodies
- plasma cell is a B cell specialized in secreting lots of antibodies
- collection of B cells in an individual is called a "repertoire"

- **clonal expansion**: B cell making multiply after encounter with their cognate anigen/pathogen

- Second response antibodies is made faster; immunological memory
- **Immunological memory** is the basis for vaccination
- Primary response Mostly weaker IgM and Secondary response Mostly Strong and fast IgG
