# Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)
---
discussed in [[Module 5]]

tampons caused TSS
Rely high absorbsion tampons especially caused it

## Staphylococcues aureus
causes TSS
- gram positive
- grape-like structures
- **local** (bacteria growth at site) infection (boils, pimples, impetigo)
- **Distant** (toxin mediated disease) TSS, staph scalded SKin Syndrome

**2 major forms**
Menstrual TSS
- associated with high absorbancy tampons

Nonmenstrual TSS:
- staphylococcues in other ares such as lungs


## TSST-1 toxin
super-atigen toxin
extreme over activation of T-Cells
T Cells are normally activated by peptide antigens
T Cells have clonal expansion when an antigen is there, but when a super-antegin is there it tricks Many many T Cells to activate creates a cytokine storm

non-specifically activates T-Cells to avoid being targeted by specific ones
