# Vaccines

discussed in [[Module 3]]
## Different forms of immunization
1. **Primary infeection**: just getting the infection
2. **Preventive Active Immunization**: a vaccination strategy that prevents infection by using somthing other than the infectious agent itself
3. **Therapeutic Active Immunization**: vaccination after disease symptoms emerge. Mostly in cancer field
4. **Passive Immunization**: transfer of antibodies from an infected individual to the individual you wish to protect. not vaccination


### Passive Immunization
1. Antiserum (for snake bites)
2. Diphtheria antitoxin

**Herd immunity**: resistance of a population to a disease due to a large fraction of the population being immune

R0 = avg num of secondary cases that arise from a primary case
Herd immunity reached if the fraction of people with immunuty exceeds (1 -  1/R0)

### Small Pox
- one of the most lethal infectious diseases of humans
- caused by a virus: Variola major
- 30% mortality rate
- provoked strong immune response
- Variolation uses small pox but infects skin so it has very low mortality for antibodies
- Variolation uses actual microbe, vaccine uses similarly
>Edward Jenner, the father of vaccination
>- Jenner wondered why milkmaids seemed resistent to small pox
>- He thought maybe the similar cow pox gave them immunity
>- He tested his theory and started injecting people with cow pox and they became immune
>- this was the first vaccine

- Vaccinia Virus is the modern smallpox vaccine 
- WHO launched a massive effort to eradicate small pox 1959-1979
- **"Ring Vaccination"**: Vaccinate all contacts of each case, creates a 'ring' of vaccinated people
- Smallpox is the only disease to be eradicated 
- only exists in freezers in CDC and Russia
- Vaccinia is a live attenuated vaccine

## Vaccine Approaches and Challenges
**Efficacy**: Does it prevent infection?
**Safety**: Does the vaccine have unwanted side effects?
good vaccine is a balance of Efficacy and Safety

**Adjuvants**: substances added to vaccines to stimulate innate immunity

**Live Attenuated Vaccines**
- made by growing pathogen in non-human cell culture, until pathogen aquires mutations that make it less virulent in Humans
- some of the most effective vaccines
- safety issues in immunocompromised people, and vaccine could cause symptoms or side effects
- (MMR) modern live attenuated vaccine are very safe

**Inactivated Vaccines**
- consists of a killed or inactivated form of the pathogen
- example influenza vaccine
- Not a live virus therefore safer, effective at eliciting antibodies
- lack of replication, may not elicit strong immunity, and generally poor at eliciting T Cell immunity

**Recombinant Protein Vaccines**
- consists of purified protein encoded by pathogen, but does not contain the whole pathogen or its nucleic acids
- easy to produce
- extremly safe
- lack of replication, may not elicit effective immunity
- generally poor at eliciting T cell immunity
- lacks PAMPs therefore does not stimulate innate immune responses nessesary to get strong adaptive immunity
- requires **adjuvents** to elicit innate immunity

**Viral Vector Vaccines**
- Genes form a pathogen of interest are inserted into the genome of a safe virus clled a vector
- the vector is live, therefore is essentially a live attenuated vaccine
- only contain a single gene from antigen so relativly safe
- strong immune response
- perhaps not as safe as recombinant  protein or killed vaccines
- manufacturing challenges
- people have immunity to some viral vectors

**DNA and mRNA Vaccines**
- involves in jection of pure DNA or mRNA that encodes pathogen proteins
- the protein is then expressed in the immunized host by the host itself
- DNA and RNA are PAMPs so no need for adjuvents
- easy and fast to produce
- same production pipeline regaurdless of pathogen bieng vaccinated
- unproven technologyy with uncertain efficacy and safety profile
- currently no approved DNA/mRNA vaccines, though this may soon change with COVID-19

### Are vaccines safe
- all medication have some rate of adverse events
- vaccines among safest medications we have
- they are intracellular pathogens
- by replicating within cells these pathogens avoid antibodies

### Why do we lack vaccines for some infectious diseases
- we lack a vaccine for the "big three" -- TB, malaria, and HIV, because not extracellular(look in slides)
