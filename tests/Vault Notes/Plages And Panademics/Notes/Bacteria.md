discussed in [[Module 2]]


**Bacteria Are Prokaryotes**

- The Sizes of pathogens can vary by million-fold

- Bacteria 0.001mm in size

- Bacteria are remarkebly diverse

>round bacteria are referred to as **cocci** or **coccus**. 
elongated bacteria are referred to as **rod bacteria**. 
These ones with bends and spiral structure are **spirillum** or **spirochetes** 

- Bacteria can produce all sorts of unusual structures

- High surface area to volume ratio; no internal membranes

- Bacteria can adapt and make [[Protein]] quickly

- fast growth rates

- able to live as parasites of larger cells

E. Coli Doubling time every 20 minutes
[[Mtb]] 24 hour doubling rate

**Because they replicate so fast, it is easy for beneficial mutations to occur**

2 types of bacteria Gram-positive and Gram-negative
![[Gram image.png]]

## Gram Negative
>In gram negative bacteria have **Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) **
>- LPS is found in the outer membrane; has many sugars
>
> LPS is a PAMP
>LPS contains 3 different parts:
>- **O-specific polysaccharide**: can be highly variable between bacteria, see [[Cholera]] for more
>- **Core polysaccaride**: 'dont need to know'
>- **Lipid A**: what is detected by the innate [[Immune System]]
- Thin layer of [[Peptidoglycan]] in the **Periplasm**
- Extra **outer membrane** not found in gram positive

## Gram Positive
- Thick layer of [[Peptidoglycan]]

## Types of Cells
Prokaryote = no nucleus

Eukayotes have nucleus

## Fun Facts
- The number of bacteria in your body is approximately equal to the number of “human” cells. Most of these bacteria reside in your intestines (colon).
- Less than 0.5% of the estimated 2 to 3 billion microbial species have been identified and many cannot be cultured.
- Microbial cycling of critical chemical elements such as carbon and nitrogen helps keep the world inhabitable for all life forms.
- Most bacteria are NOT pathogens
- The Sky: Some bacteria spend their lives in the atmosphere, growing and reproducing in the clouds above our heads (important for seeding ice crystals to form snow!).
- On Ice: Some bacterial species live in the ice of glaciers and others have often found in the snows of the North and South poles at-85°C. In Hot Springs: Species of Aquifex can live in water as hot as 95°C. Archaea are happy to grow deep sea hydrothermal vents at 106°C.
