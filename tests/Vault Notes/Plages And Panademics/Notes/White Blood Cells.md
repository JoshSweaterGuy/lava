**Phagocytes**: Dendric Cells, and Neutrophils (white blood cells that 'eat')

Phagocytosis: engulfment of particular material within a membrane-bound intracellular compartment called a phagosome
**Binds** to bateria, then **Absorbs** it, turns to **Phagosome**

## Neutrophils
- **Neutrophils** are the most important phagocytes for killing bacteria 
- Neutrophils are also sometimes called Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) or Granulocytes
- They are loaded with granules that contain toxic proteins and enzymes that kill bacteria (e.g., lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides)
- They also cause a lot of tissue damage, so they are dangerous cells to unleash

## Macrophages and Dendritic Cells (DCs)
- Found in virtually every tissue;
- Like neutrophils, macrophages and DCs can engulf and kill
bacteria. But they have additional functions as well, as we will
discuss.
- A very important function of macrophages and DCs is to
detect pathogens. They do this by using special pathogen
sensor proteins
