Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States

>Low-Risk Human Papillomavirus
Infection with most low-risk genital HPV strains doesn’t cause symptoms. These strains have no association with cancer but can lead to genital warts. HPV6 and HPV 11 are the main example

>High-Risk Human Papillomavirus
Infection with high-risk HPV can lead to extensive cervical
dysplasia and certain types of cancer. There are several high-risk
strains of HPV, but only two—types 16 and 18—cause the majority of HPV-related cancers (70%).

## HPV vaccines
- The HPV vaccine is made of the L1 protein. This protein naturally assembles to form virus like capsids (empty virions)
- The first generation vaccines (approved in 2006-2007) Cervarix: protects against HPV 16 and 18. Gardasil: protects against HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11 
- A second generation vaccine (approved in 2019) Gardasil 9: protects against HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, 6 and 11 
- HPVs 16 and 18 cause 70% of the cervical cancers HPVs 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 cause 20% of the cervical cancers
