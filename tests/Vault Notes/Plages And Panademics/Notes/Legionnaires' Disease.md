# Legionnaires' Disease
---
discussed in [[Module 5]]

in Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, 128 sickeded and 29 died
named "legionnaires' Disease", was unknown at the time


- inflammation in the lungs; kind of psnemonia 
- was no evidence of human to human transmission, but they rushed a "swine flu vaccine"
- the rushed vaccine mightve caused Guillen-Barre Syndrome in 550 people

## Legionella pneumophila
- Legionella pneumophila is a bacteria that causes legionnaires' disease
- this bacteria is difficult to grow
- 15% fatality rate
- still are outbreaks
- most recent: city of flint 87 cases, 12 dead
- affects and likes warm water supply, and AC

Legionella uses T4SS called Dot/Icm to deliver effectors into host and manipulate host cell biolofy to create niche for its replication

"hypodermic needle" to inject proteins into host
**over 300 effector proteins**
1/10 of is genes are the effector proteins
Legionella blocks lysosomal function and creates a home for itself inside of macrophages

more a 'generallist' in what it infects

natural hosts are amoebae, and is an "accidental pathogen" of humans 

T4SS and T3SS have same funtion but not evolutionarily related

grows in macrophages that are similar to Amoebae
