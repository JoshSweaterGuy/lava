also called "Consumption"

## Mtb
Mtb causes Tuberculosis

- non-motile (no flagellum)
- acid fast Bascilum
- gram "variable" -> basically gram positive

**Growth**
- **clumpy, slow-growing, and highly infectious**
- This makes it hard to work on and hard to diagnose
- can take 3 weeks to form a colony on a plate
- can take a year for a mouse to die from Mtb

- Mtb very dangerous to handle; Bio-Safty level 3
- Smear test is a popular test, but doesnt work if you dont cough up enough mtb
- the 'gold standard test' for TB is sloweer and harder but more accurate than smear test
- Mtb has a** “waxy coat” made of mycolic acids** and other lipids and has an ability to evade lysosome
- has a thick peptidoglycan layer much like Gram positive, but with extra layers on top including **mycolic acid** (memorize)

Mtb avoids being killed by arresting phagosome maturation and messes with the endosomes and not dilivered to the lysosome

Mtb usees **ESX-1 system** to stall endosome maturation

Mtb usually found in lesions in the lungs called **granulomas**

granulomas have organized aggregates of immune cells and bacteria and helps contain TB

## Symptoms
- Eradicated/delt with in richer countries due to vaccine and antibiotics, but still a big issue in poorer places. Still endemic in alot of the world

- only about a 5% of latent TB turns to active TB
- anti-TNF drugs increase your chance of getting TB

Symptoms include:
- cough (bloody)
- weight loss (wasting) – fever, nausea, etc.

>No method of diagnosis can directly detect viable bacteria in latently infected people. Instead latent TB is diagnosed indirectly — by looking for the presence of an immune response to TB (using skin test or IGRA)

## TB Diagnosis Tests
Latent TB can be diagnosed with:
- Tuberculin skin test(TST)
- Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)

For active TB
- Chest X-ray: may not show the right thing
- smear Test: fast, but less sensitive
- culture test: slow, but sensitive

**TST**: PPD injected into skin, a bump forms (inaccurate)

**IGRA**: detects a cytokine called interferon gamma that is produced by T cells in whole blood in response to MTB antigens

## Treatment
First Line Antibiotics
- **Isoniazid** (INH) (memorize)
- **Rifampin** (RIF) (memorize)

**6 months of treatment** to be finished normally, however...

**MDR TB** = multiple drug resistant TB = resistant to INH and RIF. Often requires 1-2 years of treatment with second line antibiotics.
**XDR TB** = resistant to INH, RIF and some second line drugs (often incurable; surgery sometimes required)

MDR TB increasing because people dont finish Antibiotics

There is a Meningitis TB vaccine but no vaccine for normal TB
