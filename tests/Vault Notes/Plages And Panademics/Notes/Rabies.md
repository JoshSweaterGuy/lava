## Treatment
**Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)** is the
immediate treatment of a bite victim after
rabies exposure. This prevents virus entry
into the central nervous system, which
results in imminent death. PEP consists of:
• extensive washing and local treatment
of the wound;
• a course of potent and effective rabies
vaccine
• the administration of rabies
immunoglobulin (RIG)

**treatment is expensive** so in poorer places many people dont get the treatment

after biting a person an animal will be quarerntined or if it was exposed with a rabid animal.
