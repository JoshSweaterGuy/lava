# DNA
discussed in [[Module 2]]

DNA is the genetic material of all living things


>Double Helix
>A -> T
>G -> C

- complimentary strands
atcg -> gcta



- DNA replicates by splitting in half and finishing two complimenttary strands to make 2 new DNA strands


- Humans 3,000,000,000 basepairs
~25,000 genes

- With a few exceptions, every cell in an organism
contains a complete copy of its genome

- Microbial genomes

- Small RNA virus 9000 base pairs (bp) 9 genes
