# Antibiotics
--- 
discussed in [[Module 5]]

no effect on virus or fungi
attack [[Bacteria]]
## Penicillin
- Alexander Flemming found that Penicillium a Fungus had antibacterial funtions
- Howard florey, Ernst Chain, Norman Heatley made the penicillin antibiotic

- Penicillin launched the golden age of antibiotics

90% of children with bacterial meningitis died before antibiotics
Many soilders died due to not having antibiotics

penecillin disrupts peptidoglycan and ruptures bacterial cells

## Types
- fungal
- synthetic
- other
- bacteria(Actinobacteria)
	- example Streptomyces


Disk diffusion Assay: shows what antibiotic circles work, there is zone clearing on a petri dish
vancoymcin sometimes called "antibiotic of last resort"

10-40% of people have S. aureus
MRSA (methicillin resistent S. aureus)

ESKAPE Pathogens
**E**nterococcus faecium 
**S**taphylococcus aureus 
**K**lebsiella pneumoniae 
**A**cinetobacter baumannii 
**P**seudomonas aeruginosa 
**E**nterobacter species

C. diff causes intestinal infections

Antibiotics, not very selective and sometimes kill good bacteria

**4 ways bacteria become resistent to antibiotics**
![[antibiotic resistent img.png]]

the antibiotic organism make antibiotics to kill off competing bacteria for themselves

Misuse and overuse, and extensive use in agriculture all attribute to the rise of antibiotic resistent bacteria
